# technicalsmartistry

This Repo was originally source code that I explained on my technicalsmartistry youtube channel.  But I kind of don't youtube anymore (I might again someday), and have drifted to better understanding blender, USD, and AI 3d art concepts.

It's literally experimentation on how to make art without artistic skills, but with technical ones.
